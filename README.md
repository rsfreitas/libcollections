## Important

* To compile the library you run the _make_ command. This will build the library
with plugin support (ELF format only). _sudo make install_ will install the
library in your environment to be used and *sudo make dev\_install* will install
all necessary header files to compile an application with libcollections.

Some options may be used while compiling to turn some features on:

 * CL\_IMAGEAPI=1: to export the image API
 * PYPLUGIN=1: to support Python plugins
 * JAVAPLUGIN=1: to support Java plugins

* If one is using a gcc 5 compiler, the linked target must use the option
**-fgnu89-inline**.

* If the image API needs to be used by a dependency the **CL\_USE\_IMAGEAPI**
must be used while including the library's main header.
