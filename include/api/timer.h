/**
 * @name cl_timer_register
 * @brief Creates a function as a timer function.
 *
 * Creates a mechanism, using posix timers, to register a function to be called
 * within a process over a given interval. The argument \a timers_list must be
 * NULL in its fisrt call, in such a way as to enable the creation of a
 * registered timers list so that the library can handle it properly.
 *
 * The argument \a timer_name must indicate a unique name for each timer so
 * that is possible to identify it. It is recommended the utilization of simple
 * names, and if compounds, joined by underline characters or hyphen.
 *
 * The argument \a init_function should point to a function in order to
 * initialize any type of data used by the timer function. It should receive
 * as a argument a pointer to the same argument passed to the timer function.
 *
 * The argument \a uninit_function should point to a function in order to
 * release any type of data used by the timer function. Like the initialization
 * function, it must receive as argument a pointer to the same argument passed
 * to the timer function.
 *
 * Both initialization and closing functions should return 0 on success or -1
 * otherwise. If they are unnecessary should be passed as NULL.
 *
 * The timer function, pointed by \a timer_function, is responsible for set
 * two states, internally, through 'cl_timer_set_state' function, to maintain
 * the correct internal logic during library treatments. They are:
 *
 * CL_TIMER_ST_RUNNING - As soon as the function enters.
 * CL_TIMER_ST_WAITING - Right before ending the function.
 *
 * This timer function should not have infinite loops. The system will be in
 * charge of running it again, from time to time.
 *
 * The argument \a imode should report the execution check mode between each
 * timer function call. In the case of CL_TIMER_IMODE_DEFAULT the next call will
 * wait all execution interval \a exec_interval, right after CL_TIMER_ST_WAITING
 * state. The CL_TIMER_IMODE_DISCOUNT_RUNTINME discounts the execution time spent
 * by the timer function on the next call.
 *
 * It is important to remember that regardless of the execution check mode,
 * there will never be simultaneous executions of the same timer function.
 *
 * @param [in,out] timers_list: Registered timers list.
 * @param [in] exec_interval: Execution interval of the timer (in seconds).
 * @param [in] imode: Timer execution check mode.
 * @param [in] finish_timeout: Timeout (in milliseconds) to wait for this
 *                             timer to end.
 * @param [in] timer_name: Timer identification name.
 * @param [in] timer_function: The real timer function.
 * @param [in] arg: Argument passed to the timer function.
 * @param [in] init_function: Custom initialization timer function.
 * @param [in] uninit_function: Custom closing timer function.
 *
 * @return On success returns 0 or -1 otherwise.
