 * An internal representation of a public function. It does not affect the code
 * or the function visibility. Its objective is only to let it clear what is and
 * what is not being exported from the library by looking at the code.
 *
 * Every exported function must have this at the beginning of its declaration.
 * Example:
 *
 * __PUB_API__ const char *function(int arg)
 * {
 *      // Body
 * }
